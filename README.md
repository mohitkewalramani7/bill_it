# Title : bill_it

# Description :

An Android Application that allows a user to store data about bills that have to be paid. This App makes use of a local database and allows the user to view the bills by choosing a date range.

What is attached to this project is the contents of the src/ directory in the Android App. My main areas of code writing are in the src/main/java directory where all the Java code was written, as well as in the src/main/res directory where each Activity's layout and the App's associated images are stored.
